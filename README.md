Iditarod tracker and competition app.

Data from scraping the official race standings.

Each competitor picks 3 racers and a rookie, and standings during the race are shown with potential points. At the conclusion of the race each racer and rookie is assigned a point value based on their finish result. The competitors' points are totaled up for a winner!

*This is a very rough start to the app. Future plans include registration, competitor pools, performance updates, and pick selection.*
